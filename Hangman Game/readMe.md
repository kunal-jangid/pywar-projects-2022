# Overview of the project
I made a python project called Hangman Game under PythonWarriors Python projects series.
# Libraries used in the project
**Numpy** - To optimize the code and make it faster, save memory and learn about this popular library <br>
**Random** - To randomize the selection of word from given dataset <br>
**Time** - Basically used it to give some gap between execution of commands, as to give user time to prepare for what's coming next
